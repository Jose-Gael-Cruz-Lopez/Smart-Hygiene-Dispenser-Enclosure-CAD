During my time as a CAD assistant with Generation Conscious, I worked closely with founder Greg and MIT researcher Oluwatobi Oyinlola to develop detailed parametric models for a new detergent‑sheet dispenser capactive screen. Using SolidWorks and Onshape, I made iterate designs for the product’s screen case and guided it through every phase: conceptualization, prototyping, testing, and final production. **This project was especially fulfilling because it directly supports Generation Conscious’s mission to eliminate waste; the company has pioneered zero‑water, zero‑packaging hygiene refill machines that allow students at more than 30 universities across 12 states to conveniently access liquidless hygiene products without producing packaging waste**. This was such a FUN project where I was able to contribute and innovative solution while exploring sustainability/engineering goals of the team. Go look at their mission @[Generation Conscious](https://generationconscious.co/).

## Methodology

### Measurements of Schematics 
One of the first challenges was working with the exact dimensions of the **10.1” capacitive touch screen** and its electronics. The screen itself measures **9.25 in × 5.62 in × 0.27 in**. On the back, the Raspberry Pi and the controller board occupy additional space, which required careful planning to design an enclosure that fit everything securely.  

Key considerations included:  
- The combined space the **control board + Raspberry Pi** take up behind the screen, (the edges that stick out from both components)  
- The **clearance from the front of the screen to the top of the Raspberry Pi when mounted**, which I initially estimated to be around **21 mm** and requested precise measurements for.  
- Ensuring enough depth inside the case for airflow and easy assembly without crowding the components.  
- Keeping external clutter minimal: only **one cables that exits the enclosure that connect to power outlet** and cables that go into the box, one for raspberry pi and one for the modem. All other cables stay neatly inside, connecting the Pi directly to the screen.  

This measurement step was critical to making sure the enclosure could properly house all components while maintaining functionality and sleek design.

### Prototyping

After completing the initial dimensional analysis, I began developing a series of parametric CAD prototypes to visualize, refine, and test the enclosure geometry. Using Onshape for rapid iteration and SolidWorks for advanced part relations and assemblies, I explored several design variations focused on usability, manufacturability, and internal clearance.

#### Prototype A – Baseline Screen Enclosure
This was the first iteration, designed around the raw touchscreen and Raspberry Pi layout. The goal was to verify:

Accurate fit for the 10.1” screen and control board

Adequate internal spacing for cables (BU

Proper screw-hole placement and base stability

This version served mainly as a fit-check prototype to confirm dimensional accuracy and interface alignment.
