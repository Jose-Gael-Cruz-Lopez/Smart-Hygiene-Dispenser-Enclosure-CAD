During my time as a CAD assistant with Generation Conscious, I worked closely with founder Greg and MIT researcher Oluwatobi Oyinlola to develop detailed parametric models for a new detergent‑sheet dispenser capactive screen. Using SolidWorks and Onshape, I made iterate designs for the product’s screen case and guided it through every phase: conceptualization, prototyping, testing, and final production. **This project was especially fulfilling because it directly supports Generation Conscious’s mission to eliminate waste; the company has pioneered zero‑water, zero‑packaging hygiene refill machines that allow students at more than 30 universities across 12 states to conveniently access liquidless hygiene products without producing packaging waste**. This was such a FUN project where I was able to contribute and innovative solution while exploring sustainability/engineering goals of the team. Go look at their mission @[Generation Conscious](https://generationconscious.co/).
